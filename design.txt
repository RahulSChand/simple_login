Front page has title "Bank webiste"

Has some text called

"Welcome to bankwebsite Bank101"

Then there are two buttons

1) Create your account (multiple step workflow)
2) Check exchange rates qoute (1 step workflow)

Inside Login there will be a bunch of fields (initally all text)
1) Need to fill the fields
2) click on create account 
(??) Maybe some restrictions on password so that there is difficulty

There will be some amount in your Bank
Go to the transaction page -> Add a beneficinary -> Given some initial logic -> calculate amount to be added -> Transfer (You need to click on some button -> like transfer to account or from account) -> based on if u get this wrong or correct -> Either success (Good)
-> Failure (start again or end?) -> Not sure

Simple design (What can be tested)

1. Single click workflow of reading exchange rate -> Need a way to read values and return

2. Multi-step workflow -> Is there -> It also has this thing where you need to remember stuff
    -> What it needs is to use logic and figure out what to put in the date column and stuff based on errors


Before that what do we have currently
1. Single click workflow
2. Multiple click workflow
3. Not being able to solve something

4. Figuring out what fields to fill
    - An error happens when u fill wrong field
    - Or the user should know what to write in each field
